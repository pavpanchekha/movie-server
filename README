Movie-Server 0.5
================

Movie-server is a simple tool to serve movies from armless computers.
It lets you access your media library and control playback from a
smartphone.

The main goal of movie-server is a slick interface and a seamless user
experience.  The current approach is to sacrifice scope and features
if such is required to provide a better experience.  New features have
to come with convincing user-interface stories.

Movie-server makes use of the huge growth of free-software media
solutions.  But movie-server is not affiliated with any.
