Movie-Server 0.5
================

Movie-server is a simple tool for armless computers to server movies.
Despite the name, movie-server is in fact capable of more than simply
serving movies --- any number of modules can provide
mutually-exclusive media sources, and movie-server will present them
to you. To configure these media sources, create a file called
``config.py``; an example file would be::

    from moviedir import MovieDir

    MODULES = [MovieDir("/var/movies")]

Any number of modules can be configured in the same way.
