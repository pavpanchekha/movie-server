Installing Movie-Server
=======================

Movie-server depends on the Python libraries ``flup`` and ``web.py``.
Further, it is probably best to install ``lighttpd``, together with
its fastcgi support, since this is the only currently supported web
server for movie-server installations (other than the web.py
development server).

Modules also have their own dependencies; see the module's
documentation for more.  In short, you probably want to install
``mplayer``, ``vlc``, or ``mpd`` (or perhaps several).

To install movie-server, copy the ``src/`` directory to anywhere you
please.  Then make a copy of :file:`lighttpd.conf.example` into
:file:`lighttpd.conf` and edit the file to reflect the directory you
chose.  Copy :file:`src/config.py.example` to :file:`src/config.py`
and modify the settings there; see :doc:`modules` for more on
configuring modules. Finally, start up lighttpd and test your installation.
